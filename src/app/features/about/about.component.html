    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    
    <p>
      Welcome to Art Not Clothes Gallery — a space where style meets narrative. We reimagine apparel, turning every garment into a work of art and a story to be worn. With a modern yet minimalist design, our approach is rooted in the belief that fashion is a personal narrative.
